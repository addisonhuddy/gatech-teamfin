# JogRx
### Final Presentation Outline

## Project Overview (Henry)
* Problem
* Target end-user

## User Research (Addison)
* Conducted exploratory interviews with faculty and students at California Northstate University Medical School in Sacramento, CA
* One M1 medical student wore a Fitbit ChargeHR activity monitor to test out the JogRx system

## Research findings (Ethan)
* Consistently found that activity data is helpful to medical professional, but not readily available

## Solution (Jelena)
* Integrate wearable data directly with patient electronic medical records
* Use correct LONIC codes to properly convey the patient's activity

## Demo
1. Simple signup flow (Huan)
2. Fitbit activity data (Oscar)
3. FHIR data (Oscar)

## Summary (Henry)
* We believe that a solution like JogRx will provide for more meaningful interactions between physicians and patients
* However, the process of on-boarding a new patient on a wearable platform remains a large hurdle
